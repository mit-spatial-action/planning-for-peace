	abstract = {{OpenAlex} is a new, fully-open scientific knowledge graph ({SKG}), launched to replace the discontinued Microsoft Academic Graph ({MAG}). It contains metadata for 209M works (journal articles, books, etc); 2013M disambiguated authors; 124k venues (places that host works, such as journals and online repositories); 109k institutions; and 65k Wikidata concepts (linked to works via an automated hierarchical multi-tag classifier). The dataset is fully and freely available via a web-based {GUI}, a full data dump, and high-volume {REST} {API}. The resource is under active development and future work will improve accuracy and coverage of citation information and author/institution parsing and deduplication.},
